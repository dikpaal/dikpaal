### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Dikpaal**](https://dikpaalpatel.com), a software engineer and artist in Vancouver, BC.

I currently work as an AI engineer intern at [**@Sendbird**](https://github.com/sendbird), where I help build Delight.AI that makes Sendbird money. Previously, I was a founding engineer at [**@Thirdslate**](https://thirdslate.com) and an ML reasearch intern at a computational neuroscience lab at [**@UBC**](https://github.com/UBC-CS).

Outside of work, I'm interested in reading about statistics, finance, and economics. I sketch cars, play a lot of sports, and watch anime.
