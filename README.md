I'm a passionate computer science student who believes that understanding the intricacies behind every concept is essential for mastery, which drives me to delve into the "under the hood"/mathematical/conceptual working of each ML algorithm I encounter. This curiosity and dedication enable me to develop innovative solutions and continuously expand my knowledge in the ever-evolving tech landscape. When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, doing calisthenics, or watching anime :)
